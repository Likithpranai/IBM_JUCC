2. GREATER BOSTON AREA GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Generated using traditional)

Transportation:
The T (subway) is the main public transit. Charlie Card saves money on fares. Buses connect areas not served by the T.

Housing:
Allston, Brighton, and Somerville are popular with students. Start housing search early as competition is high.

Food:
Try local seafood, especially clam chowder. Many student discounts available with university ID.

Activities:
Walk the Freedom Trail, visit museums (many have free student days), and attend Red Sox games at Fenway.

Tips:
Winters are harsh - invest in proper clothing. Many coffee shops offer good study spaces.
