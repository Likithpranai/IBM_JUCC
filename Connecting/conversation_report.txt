Hello Li Wei! Great to hear from you. I'm excited to be going to HKUST. Do you have any tips for living in Hong Kong?

Definitely! Hong Kong has amazing food and efficient public transport. I'd recommend getting an Octopus card as soon as you arrive. Also, the weather is quite humid in summer, so be prepared!
